# Simulating Stock Market Returns & Crash Risk
Financial markets are a wellspring of quantifiable data, but the data generation process remains a deep mystery. Using daily stock market returns naively can lead to an underestimation of the risk of extended sell-offs similar to the February-March 2020 episode when the S&P 500 Index tumbled 34% over 23 trading days. An empirical analysis comparing the inferences gained from historical 1928-2019 daily, monthly & quarterly returns data of the S&P 500 Index.

The analysis reveals that the volatility clustering and aggregational normality phenomena suggest that historical daily returns statistics underestimate the risk of extended volatility spikes in the S&P 500 Index, and significant drawdowns of 30% or more over a month. Monthly 1928–2019 historical data would have provided higher probabilities of a scenario akin to the February-March 2020 crash, than using historical daily returns data. More recent daily data from the 1990–2019 period would have failed to foresee such an eventuality altogether.
